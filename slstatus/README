# Slstatus - Information In Your DWM Bar
All of the changes here (besides the script to show my screen brightness) are in `config.def.h`.

The only changes you'll probably want to make are there, too. The `run_command` option that works the backlight percentage is currently the full path to the script. If you want to use that module, be sure to update the command.

Besides that, you shouldn't need anything extra.

## Installation
After you make your changes, just run -
```
sudo make clean install
```
and you're good to go!
